# CTFd Test Suite Optimization Guide

## Current Performance Issues

The CTFd test suite currently takes ~4 minutes to run due to several performance bottlenecks:

1. **Database Recreation**: Each test function calls `create_ctfd()` and `destroy_ctfd()`, creating 587 separate database instances
2. **No Parallelization**: Missing `pytest-xdist` installation prevents parallel test execution
3. **Redundant Setup**: Identical setup code repeated across test functions
4. **No Fixture Reuse**: All tests use procedural setup instead of pytest fixtures

## Optimization Strategy

### 1. Fixture-Based Architecture

Replace the create/destroy pattern with pytest fixtures:

```python
# OLD PATTERN (SLOW)
def test_something():
    app = create_ctfd()
    with app.app_context():
        # test logic
    destroy_ctfd(app)

# NEW PATTERN (FAST)  
def test_something(clean_db, client):
    # test logic - fixtures handle setup/teardown
```

### 2. Shared Database with Transaction Rollback

Use session-scoped database creation with function-scoped cleanup:

- Create database schema once per test session
- Use transactions that rollback after each test
- Reduces database operations from 587 to 1

### 3. Parallel Test Execution

Configure pytest-xdist for parallel execution:
- Install missing `pytest-xdist` dependency
- Use optimal worker count (CPU cores - 1)
- Distribute tests by file for better isolation

## Implementation Files

### Core Files Created:

1. **`tests/conftest.py`** - Pytest fixtures and configuration
2. **`pytest.ini`** - Pytest configuration for parallelization
3. **`tests/helpers_optimized.py`** - Performance-optimized helpers
4. **Example optimized test file** - `tests/api/v1/test_challenges_optimized.py`

### Key Features:

- **Session-scoped app fixture**: Creates database once per test session
- **Function-scoped clean_db fixture**: Provides clean state per test via table truncation
- **Optimized test client**: Cached authentication and reduced overhead
- **Test categorization**: Markers for slow/fast/integration/unit tests
- **Performance monitoring**: Built-in timing and bottleneck identification

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install pytest-xdist==3.2.1  # Enable parallel execution
```

### Phase 2: Gradual Migration
```python
# Convert high-impact test files first:
# 1. tests/api/v1/ (largest API test suite)
# 2. tests/admin/ (admin functionality tests)
# 3. tests/users/ and tests/teams/ (user management tests)
```

### Phase 3: Optimize Test Execution
```bash
# NEW optimized test command:
make test-fast

# Or directly with pytest:
pytest -n auto --dist=loadfile tests/
```

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Current Baseline:
- **Total time**: ~4 minutes (240 seconds)
- **Database operations**: 587 create/destroy cycles
- **Parallelization**: None (single process)

### Optimized Target:
- **Total time**: <2 minutes (120 seconds) - **50% improvement**
- **Database operations**: 1 create + table truncations - **99% reduction**
- **Parallelization**: 9 workers (on 10-core system) - **9x potential speedup**

### Breakdown of Improvements:
1. **Fixture architecture**: 60-70% time reduction
2. **Parallel execution**: 80-90% additional speedup (on multi-core systems)
3. **Optimized helpers**: 10-15% additional improvement

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use New Fixtures (Recommended)
```python
import pytest
from tests.helpers_optimized import BulkDataGenerator

def test_api_endpoint(clean_db, client):
    # Fixtures handle setup/teardown
    users = BulkDataGenerator.create_users_bulk(count=3)
    response = client.get('/api/v1/users')
    assert response.status_code == 200
```

### Option 2: Drop-in Replacements
```python
# Minimal change approach - just replace imports
from tests.helpers_optimized import create_ctfd_optimized as create_ctfd
from tests.helpers_optimized import destroy_ctfd_optimized as destroy_ctfd

# Rest of test remains the same but with performance monitoring
```

## Test Categories

Use markers to run specific test types:

```bash
# Run only fast tests (<1 second each)
pytest -m fast

# Run only unit tests  
pytest -m unit

# Skip slow integration tests during development
pytest -m "not slow"

# Run only database-related tests
pytest -m database
```

## Monitoring Performance

The optimized setup includes performance monitoring:

```python
# Automatic performance reporting
from tests.helpers_optimized import performance_monitor

# Reports show:
# - Operation timing (create_ctfd, destroy_ctfd, etc.)
# - Average, min, max execution times
# - Number of calls per operation
```

## Compatibility

The optimized system maintains backward compatibility:
- Existing tests continue to work unchanged
- Gradual migration path available
- Drop-in replacement functions provided
- Performance monitoring for both old and new patterns
