# Docker Build Issue: Exit Code 100

## Issue Description

When attempting to build the CTFd Docker image, the build process fails with exit code 100 during the `apt-get update` and package installation steps.

### Commands Used for Investigation

```bash
sh -i [REDACTED-FOR-REPO] -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ec2-user@[REDACTED-FOR-REPO] "sudo cat /var/log/cloud-init-output.log | grep -A 10 -B 5 'exit code: 100'"
```

### Error Details

From the cloud-init logs:

```
"started": "2025-07-28T23:26:02.874909726Z",
"completed": "2025-07-28T23:26:03.634079671Z",
"error": "process \"/bin/sh -c apt-get update     && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends         build-essential         libffi-dev         libssl-dev         git     && apt-get clean     && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*     && python -m venv /opt/venv\" did not complete successfully: exit code: 100"
```

And in the release stage:
```

"completed": "2025-07-28T23:26:03.638391577Z",

```

## Root Cause

The issue occurs because:

1. **Outdated Base Image**: The original `python:3.9-slim-buster` image uses Debian Buster, which reached end-of-life in September 2022
2. **Package Repository Issues**: Debian Buster repositories are no longer actively maintained, causing `apt-get update` to fail with 404 errors
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: The old base image contains known security vulnerabilities

### Investigation Steps

1. **Original Error from Cloud-Init Logs**: Applied to fix_dockerfi... Run 50
   - This showed: Apply to fix_dockerfi... Run 100

2. **Manual Docker Build Attempt**: Apply to fix_dockerfi... Run d
   - This showed the detailed build output with 404 errors like: Apply to fix_dockerfi... ]

3. **The Root Cause**: The error messages revealed that the Debian Buster repositories were returning 404 errors because:
   - Debian Buster reached end-of-life (EOL) in September 2022
   - The package repositories for Buster are no longer maintained
   - The python:3.9-slim-buster base image was trying to access non-existent repositories
   - This is what led us to update the Dockerfile to use python:3.11-slim-bullseye instead, which has active and maintained package repositories.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Python Version
- Changed from `python:3.9-slim-buster` to `python:3.11-slim-bullseye`
- Python 3.11 is more current and stable than 3.9

### 2. Updated Base OS
- Changed from Debian Buster to Debian Bullseye
- Bullseye is actively maintained and receives security updates
- Explicitly specified `-bullseye` tag for better control

### 3. Files Modified
- `Dockerfile` - Updated both build and release stages
- `dd-inviter/Dockerfile` - Updated build stage
- `scripts/pip-compile.sh` - Updated container image reference

## Why This Fix Works

1. **Active Support**: Debian Bullseye is currently supported until June 2026
2. **Security Updates**: Regular security patches are available
3. **Package Availability**: All required packages are available in Bullseye repositories
4. **Compatibility**: Python 3.11 maintains compatibility with existing CTFd codebase

## Verification

The fix resolves:
- ✅ Docker build failures (exit code 100)
- ✅ Package installation issues
- ✅ Security vulnerabilities in base image
- ✅ Repository connectivity problems

## Impact

- **Build Reliability**: Docker builds now complete successfully
- **Security**: Reduced vulnerability count in container images
- **Maintainability**: Using actively supported base images
- **Performance**: Python 3.11 provides better performance than 3.9
